# Extension Assets

This folder should contain the extension icons:

- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

For the Explain-It extension, these should be brain/AI-themed icons with the neon cyan color scheme to match the brand.

You can create these icons using:
1. Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Canva
2. Icon generators like Icon Kitchen
3. AI image generators with prompts like "brain icon, neon cyan, dark background, minimalist"

The icons should be clear and recognizable even at small sizes, maintaining the "smart & sneaky" hacker aesthetic of the extension.
